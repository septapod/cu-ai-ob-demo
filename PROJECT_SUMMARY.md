## üìã Project Overview

A **fully interactive web-based demonstration** showing how AI and open banking work together to make fairer, smarter lending decisions for credit unions. Designed to be presented to **100+ Mississippi credit union CEOs** at a keynote presentation.

**Core Story:** Marcus Johnson (32, gig economy driver) applies for a $5,000 auto loan with a 620 credit score. Traditional underwriting declines him. AI-enhanced analysis using open banking data sees the complete picture (perfect payment history, verified income, strong financial management) and approves him at favorable rates.

**Key Message:** *"Same person. Different data. Different decision."*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Considerations

### Timing
- Screen 2 (Traditional) now waits for manual button click (by design)
- This gives you time to emphasize the decline before moving to AI
- Total flow from start to complete decision: ~10 seconds

### Browser Caching
- After any updates, hard refresh needed:
  - Mac: Cmd+Shift+R
  - Windows: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Or open in Incognito/Private mode

### Screen Recording
- Chrome performs smoothest
- Safari also good
- Animations may appear choppy in some screen recorders at normal speed
- Recommend recording at 1920x1080, 60fps

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Demo works on iPad (stacks vertically)
- Not optimized for small phones
- Presentation primarily for 1920x1080 screens

## üîê Security & Compliance Notes

### For Real Implementation
This is a DEMO PROTOTYPE. For production, you would need:
- ‚úÖ Real open banking API integration (Plaid, FDX, Finicity)
- ‚úÖ Actual ML/AI models for analysis
- ‚úÖ Database for member data storage
- ‚úÖ Authentication & authorization
- ‚úÖ Audit logging (FCRA compliance)
- ‚úÖ Member consent management
- ‚úÖ GLBA, FCRA, state lending law compliance
- ‚úÖ Human credit officer review workflow
- ‚úÖ Encrypted data transmission (TLS 1.3+)

Current demo shows UI/UX concepts with hardcoded data.
