## Demo Introduction (Before Starting)

**Opening remarks (~1 minute):**

> "I want to show you something that's happening right now in fintech, and that your credit unions could be doing tomorrow. This is about seeing your members clearly.
>
> I'm going to walk through a real scenario: Marcus Johnson applies for a $5,000 auto loan. Traditional underwriting would decline him immediately. But when we actually look at his financial picture, he's a good borrower. Let me show you how."

**Click: "Analyze Application"**

---

## Flow Timing & Talking Points

### SCREEN 1: APPLICATION FORM (5-10 seconds of remarks)

**What you're seeing:**
- Member: Marcus Johnson (32 years old, gig economy driver)
- Loan: $5,000 used auto
- Credit score: **620** (prominently displayed in amber warning)

**Talking points:**
> "Here's Marcus Johnson. He's applied for a $5,000 auto loan to replace his old car. He's been a member here for 2 years and 3 months - a solid member.
>
> But look at his credit score: **620**. It's below your preferred threshold of 660. In traditional underwriting, this is where the conversation ends. The system says 'decline,' and we move on to the next application.
>
> But wait - let me show you what traditional underwriting is actually missing about Marcus."

**Pause. Click the button.**

---

### SCREEN 2: TRADITIONAL ANALYSIS (30 seconds of remarks)

**Timing:** This screen appears for 2.5 seconds then auto-transitions, but talk through it as it loads.

**What you're seeing:**
- Credit score: 620 (below threshold)
- DTI: "Unable to calculate" - insufficient documentation
- Employment: "Pending" - gig economy is hard to verify

**Talking points:**
> "This is what your current system would see. Credit score is 620 - decline. DTI is indeterminate because we can't document his income properly. He drives for Uber and DoorDash - how do you verify that with W2s and pay stubs?
>
> There's no employment verification letter. There's no way to prove income in the traditional framework. So the system says: **'Likely Decline - insufficient documented income'**
>
> This is where thousands of qualified borrowers fall through the cracks."

*Watch as it transitions with "Running AI-enhanced analysis..." message*

> "But now let me show you what happens when we connect to his real financial data through open banking..."

---

### SCREEN 3: AI ANALYSIS DASHBOARD (Full flow: ~10 seconds of animation, ~90 seconds of remarks)

**Animation sequence:**
- 0-4s: Data sources load sequentially (1 card every 0.8s)
- 4.5-7s: AI reasoning appears line-by-line
- 7.5s+: Decision panel and comparison appear

**Phase 1: Data Sources Loading (First 4-5 seconds)**

*As each card lights up, narrate:*

> "Now watch what happens when Marcus gives us permission to see his actual financial picture through open banking.
>
> First, we connect to his Artificial CU accounts..." [source-1 lights up]
> "Checking balance, savings balance, membership history."
>
> Then his connected accounts..." [source-2 lights up]
> "Chase checking, Wells Fargo credit card - only using 15% of his limit."
>
> Then - this is the key part - his income." [source-3 lights up]
> "Uber deposits: $1,800/month. DoorDash deposits: $600/month. Total verified income: **$2,400 monthly**.
>
> But it's not just income - we look at his payment history..." [source-4 lights up]
> "24 months of data. **100% on-time payments**. Not a single missed payment across any account. Not one overdraft in 18 months.
>
> And his spending patterns." [source-5 lights up]
> "We can see what he spends on rent, utilities, groceries. Average expenses: $1,950/month. Every month he saves around $200. That's consistent financial discipline despite variable income."

**Phase 2: AI Reasoning (Seconds 4.5-7)**

*As each reasoning item appears, amplify the insight:*

> "Now here's where the AI does something traditional underwriting can't: it actually **reasons** about what this data means.
>
> **Income Verification:** Despite non-traditional income, Marcus shows consistent $2,400/month over 24 months. Real, verifiable income. Not a spike - a pattern.
>
> **Payment Behavior:** Perfect history. This person **prioritizes** financial obligations. When he makes a commitment, he keeps it - even when income is variable.
>
> **Cash Flow Management:** He's saving $200/month **on average**, while earning variable income. That's financial maturity most people don't have. Look at the spending volatility - it's LOW. He knows what he needs to spend on, and he sticks to it.
>
> **Current Capacity:** His proposed $150 payment? That's 6.25% of his monthly income. For someone who consistently manages $1,950 in monthly expenses and saves $200, this is comfortably affordable.
>
> **And yes, the credit score problem:** That 620? It's not because Marcus is irresponsible. It's a thin credit file. He's new to traditional credit, and his gig economy income structure doesn't fit the normal models. But that's a *data problem*, not a *risk problem*. The data we actually have shows zero risk."

**Phase 3: The Decision (Seconds 7.5+)**

**PAUSE and let this sink in:**

> "So the AI system looks at this complete picture and says: **APPROVE**.
>
> - Risk assessment: **LOW**
> - Suggested rate: **6.75%** - that's your preferred member rate
> - Monthly payment: **$149.50** for 36 months
> - Confidence score: **94%**
>
> This person should be APPROVED. The data is clear."

---

### SCREEN 3 CONTINUED: The Comparison (Key Visual Moment)

*Scroll down or point to the comparison box*

> "Let me show you the stark difference:
>
> **Traditional system:** DECLINE. Insufficient documented income. That's the end of the conversation.
>
> **AI-enhanced system:** APPROVE. Strong financial management, verified cash flow, perfect payment history. This is a LOW RISK borrower.
>
> **Same person. Different data. Different decision.**
>
> And this isn't just one borrower. This is a **market segment** you're missing. Think about how many members in your portfolio look like this. Gig economy workers. Freelancers. Contract workers. People with valid income that doesn't come with a W2. People with thin credit files but proven payment behavior.
>
> Traditional underwriting says: 'We don't have the data we need, so decline.'
>
> AI says: 'We have the data we need - it's just different data, and it tells a clear story.'"

### SCREEN 3 CONTINUED: Expand "Why This Decision?" (Optional, 2-3 minutes)

**If time allows and audience is engaged:**

Click the expandable section to show:

**"How We Made This Decision"**

> "Here's the process:
> - We accessed Marcus's permission-based financial data through secure open banking
> - We analyzed 24 months of actual cash flow - not what someone claims to earn, but what actually hit his bank account
> - We identified income patterns that traditional systems would never see
> - We verified perfect payment history across all his obligations
> - We calculated realistic affordability based on his actual spending patterns"

**"Member Privacy & Control"**

> "Let's be clear about something important: Marcus had to **agree** to this. He authorized this analysis. He can revoke it anytime. His data is analyzed but not stored. Everything is encrypted with bank-level security. He can see exactly what we looked at.
>
> This isn't sneaking around behind members' backs. This is **giving members a better chance** by looking more carefully at their real financial life."

**"Impact for Your Credit Union"**

> "Why does this matter for you?
> - You approve qualified borrowers that competitors decline
> - Your portfolio risk is lower because you have REAL data
> - Your members feel understood - you see them completely
> - You compete with fintechs at their own game
> - You live your mission of **financial inclusion** more powerfully"

---

## Closing Remarks (After Demo)

> "This technology exists **today**. Fintechs are using it. Credit unions can use it too.
>
> You don't need to replace your credit officers - they'll actually be more effective because they'll have better information. And you don't need to make a choice between being fair and being prudent. Better data makes you **both**.
>
> The real question isn't whether to do this. The question is: how fast can you move? Your competitors are already moving."

---

## Key Phrases to Emphasize

Repeat these if you want them to stick:

- **"620 credit score says decline. Real data says approve."**
- **"This isn't one person. This is a market segment you're missing."**
- **"You have the permission. You just need the data and the AI."**
- **"Fintechs are doing this now. Credit unions can too."**
- **"Same person. Different data. Different decision."**
- **"Perfect payment history. Verified income. Low risk. APPROVE."**

## Questions You'll Likely Get

### "Isn't this just another algorithm that could be biased?"

> "Good question. Yes, we need to design and test carefully to avoid bias. But here's what's different: we're using **actual behavior data**, not proxies. We're seeing what Marcus **actually does** with money, not guessing based on protected characteristics. And we're building in **transparency** - we can explain every part of the decision in plain English. That's actually better than a pure credit score, which is a black box."

### "What about regulatory risk?"

> "Open banking is built on regulated protocols. Member consent is explicit and documented. The GLBA protects this - members have always had the right to share their information for credit decisions. We're using secure, audited connections (Plaid, FDX). And human credit officers are still in the loop, just making better decisions with better information. It's not unregulated - it's *newly* regulated correctly."

### "Won't this change our approval rates too much?"

> "Maybe - in a good way. You'll probably approve 5-10% more qualified borrowers. But you'll also **decline faster** on obvious problems, because you can see the full picture immediately. What changes isn't volume - it's accuracy. You're saying yes to people who will succeed, and no to people who won't."

### "How much does this cost to implement?"

> "Open banking APIs are $0.50-$3 per lookup. Good AI models are accessible via APIs or in-house training. Your biggest cost is integration time, not the technology. The ROI comes from reduced charge-offs and the new members you can lend to profitably."

### "Do other credit unions do this?"

> "Not yet - you'd be first. But fintechs, community banks, and even some larger credit unions are starting to pilot this. The technology is ready. The regulatory path is clear. The gap is adoption speed."
